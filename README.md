## XIQ_PPSK_CSV_Importer.py

##### line 22
```
XIQ_token = "****"
```
A token can be generated using the POST /auth/apitoken with both the "enduser",“pcg:key” permissions set in the body. This can be done from the [Swagger page](https://api.extremecloudiq.com/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/openapi/swagger-config&layout=BaseLayout#/Authorization/generateApiToken).

##### line 24
```
usergroupID = "enter the user group id"
```
Each XIQ User Group will be assigned a unique ID when it gets created. This is something that gets used by the backend systems and not seen in the GUI. The easiest way to get the ID is from the [Swagger page](https://api.extremecloudiq.com/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/openapi/swagger-config&layout=BaseLayout#/Configuration%20-%20User%20Management/listUserGroups). 

### Optional

```
filename = "PPSK_Users.csv"

The file name can be changed if needed.
